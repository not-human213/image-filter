<h2>Image Filtering Project ðŸŽ¨</he>
This repository contains my Image Filtering project, developed as part of the CS50 Week 4 Assignment. The project demonstrates how to implement basic image filtering techniques in C, working with BMP image files.

Features âœ¨
Grayscale Filter: Converts an image into shades of gray.
Sepia Filter: Applies a sepia tone for a warm, vintage look.
Reflection: Creates a mirrored reflection of the image.
Blur Filter: Smoothens the image using a simple box blur algorithm.
Tools & Technologies ðŸ› 
Language: C
Images: BMP format
Frameworks/Libraries: N/A (Implemented from scratch)
